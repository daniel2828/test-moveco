# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

I didn't add any other library , I thought to use bootstrap but as it isn't necessary to make the page responsive finally I decided not to use it.

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

The arrow Icon is slighly different from the image provided, so I'll try to search another one.
Also with more time I'll use more info from JSON data, as the agent_rating to order the flights (or use any other parameter to sort the information)

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

About the code and project structure, I think I've made a good work on it

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Try to adapt all the structure as the image. Not very difficult but it has take me the biggest part of the time

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

It's a good test, but I would prefer to use my own project structure and components.
